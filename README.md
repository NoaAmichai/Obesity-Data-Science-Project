# Obesity- Classification Project
By Noa Amichai and Noa Sapir

# Project Intro 
Obesity is a condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to such an extent that it may have a negative effect on health.
<br> In 2016, more than 1.9 billion adults, 18 years and older, were overweight. For comparison, the world population in this yeas was 7.4 billion (inclouding ages lower than 18) <br>
more than 25.6% of the world population.

# Research Question
Can we predict which weight status a person defined? 

# Data Sources
We took the DataSet from this website:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Estimation+of+obesity+levels+based+on+eating+habits+and+physical+condition+

### Data Set Information:
This dataset include data for the estimation of obesity levels in individuals from the countries of Mexico, Peru and Colombia, based on their eating habits and physical condition. The data contains 17 attributes and 2111 records, the records are labeled with the class variable NObesity (Obesity Level), that allows classification of the data using the values of Insufficient Weight to 7 catagories: 
<ul> 
  <li> Insufficient_Weight </li>
<li> Normal_Weight </li>
<li> Overweight_Level_I </li>
<li> Overweight_Level_II </li>
<li> Obesity_Type_I </li>
<li> Obesity_Type_II </li>
<li> Obesity_Type_III </ul> 
<br>
77% of the data was generated synthetically using the Weka tool and the SMOTE filter, 23% of the data was collected directly from users through a web platform.

### Models
We have tryied several models to declaire which one is the best for our project.<br> 
The models we ran:
Decision Trees, Random Forest and KNN.
