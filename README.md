# Obesity- Classification Project
By Noa Amichai and Noa Sapir

# Project Intro 
Obesity is a condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to such an extent that it may have a negative effect on health.<br>
Obesity is a major cause of disability and is correlated with various diseases and conditions, particularly cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, certain types of cancer, and osteoarthritis. <br> 
A reciprocal link has been found between obesity and depression, with obesity increasing the risk of clinical depression and also depression leading to a higher chance of developing obesity.<br>
In 2015, 600 million adults (12%) and 100 million children were obese in 195 countries.<br>
Public health officials view it as one of the most serious public health problems of the 21st century.

# Research Question
Can we predict the human's weight type by using certain features?

# Data Sources
We took the DataSet from this website:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Estimation+of+obesity+levels+based+on+eating+habits+and+physical+condition+

### Data Set Information:
This dataset include data for the estimation of obesity levels in individuals from the countries of Mexico, Peru and Colombia, based on their eating habits and physical condition. The data contains 17 attributes and 2111 records, the records are labeled with the class variable NObesity (Obesity Level), that allows classification of the data using the values of Insufficient Weight to 7 catagories: 
<ul> 
  <li> Insufficient_Weight </li>
<li> Normal_Weight </li>
<li> Overweight_Level_I </li>
<li> Overweight_Level_II </li>
<li> Obesity_Type_I </li>
<li> Obesity_Type_II </li>
<li> Obesity_Type_III </ul> 
<br>
77% of the data was generated synthetically using the Weka tool and the SMOTE filter, 23% of the data was collected directly from users through a web platform.

### Models
We have tryied several models to declaire which one is the best for our project.<br> 
The models we ran:
Decision Trees, Random Forest and KNN.
